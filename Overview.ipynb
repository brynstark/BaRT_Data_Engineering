    "\n",
    "This is a final project for my DSCI6007 Data Engineering class. The basic idea is to provide BART riders with a little insight via Tweets that might be relevant to their travels. For example, if there's a Giants game at ATT Park, that may be helpful to know for someone trying to travel from the East Bay into downtown San Francisco. Or, as I'll show in an example, if one's trying to travel to/through downtown Oakland and there's a protest blocking the freeway ([it happened recently](http://abc7news.com/news/all-lanes-of-i-880-in-oakland-reopen-after-protest-blocks-highway/1418202/)), it may be best to take BART instead of driving, but it also helps to be aware that the area may be crowded surrounding the 12th Street Oakland City Center BART station.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used [TwitterAPI](https://github.com/geduldig/TwitterAPI) to stream tweets (for info about the API, see the [Twitter developer page](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview)), and the static [BART API](http://api.bart.gov/docs/sched/routesched.aspx) to gather schedules for different BART routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project mainly serves as practice with different Data Engineering technologies, with less of an emphasis on Data Science and analytics."
